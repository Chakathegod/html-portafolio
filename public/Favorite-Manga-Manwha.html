<h1>Ruben's Favorite Manga/Manwha Ranking Project</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 Manga/Manwha stories of all time</h2>
 <hr />

<h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
<p>By far my favorite of all time. 
Togashi is the goat, and even though it's currently incomplete what is currently out is already a great story.
The characters, the power system, the variety of abilities that come from said power system.
The fact that Togashi doesn't shy away from certain themes is also something that makes this more interesting.</p>
 
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>The manga's world building is just insane. 
Everytime Oda shows us more of this world it just it gets me more and more hyped.
The introduction of new characters add so many more paths in which the story could go. 
I'm also a huge fan of how he re-introduces characters and story lines from past volumes and fleshes them out even more.</p>

<h3>Tower of God</h3>
<p>These spots get more difficult, but I love this story so much.
I enjoy stories that have expansive world building posibilities, especially when an author can really deliver.
One such author is SIU, Slave In Utero. 
There are over 600 chapters as of this moment, and yet it feels as if we've barely scratched the surface.
Pivotal aspects of this story, like Ten Family Leaders have not all been introduced. 
This story can go in so many directions, definitely has the potential of going up the rankings once it's complete.
